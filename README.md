# Equal Experts Fizzbuzz Technical Assessment

As part of my technical assessment for Equal Experts, I've created this little React app based on the description provided.

To make my life easier, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Version

9bf6e09ab90a49cba9c3a6d43aaed66178f4ef4a

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

This is required before you begin. It'll obviously install all project dependencies and allow you to build/run/test the app.\

### `yarn start`

This runs the Fizzbuzz app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Should you want to modify the app, the page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
I've used React Test Library (which comes as part of Create React App) and written a few basic functional tests to make sure the app works as expected.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the Fizzbuzz app for production (should that be required) to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Again, I can't take any credit for this. I've used Create React App to make my life simpler and because I don't like to reinvent the wheel if I can help it.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
